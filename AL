CORE CONTRACT STRUCTURE

formation - Mostly correct, but requires a citation fix. Alabama contract formation rules are accurate, but the Statute of Frauds should be split between Ala. Code § 8-9-2 and UCC § 7-2-201.

consideration - correct 
mutual_assent - correct
capacity - correct
severability - correct
modification - correct

assignment - NOTE:
Alabama assignment section needs a scope fix. Ala. Code § 8-23-7 applies only to motor vehicle installment sales contracts, not to consumer service contracts generally. Summary should be narrowed to that context.

governing_law - NOTE: Alabama Constitution Amendment 884 is not a governing-law or choice-of-law provision (it concerns religious freedom). Choice-of-law enforceability in Alabama is based on common law and public policy, not Amendment 884. The authority citation should be changed or removed.
